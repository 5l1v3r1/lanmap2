<h1>Summary</h1>
<p>It has been noticed by some people that some Windows 2000, 
(and Windows XP, and Windows Server 2003) etc machines send 
a multicast packet to group address 239.255.2.2. I have <i>some</i> 
information on this subject...  I hope it will be of use.</p>

<p>In summary I do not believe that these packets create any security 
risk.</p>

<h1>What</h1>

<p>It is a UDP packet destined to IP Group Address 239.255.2.2 and port 
9753.  The data content of the UDP packet is "Hostname=" followed by 
the PC's hostname (and then a LF and a NUL).  The multicast address 
239.255.2.2 is registered at <a href="http://www.iana.org/">IANA's</a> 
<a href="http://www.iana.org/assignments/multicast-addresses">Multicast 
Addresses</a> list as "rasadv" i.e.</p>
<pre class="CodeExample">...
239.255.000.000-239.255.255.255 Site-Local Scope           [Meyer,RFC2365]
239.255.002.002  rasadv                                    [Thaler]
</pre>

Note also that the address is within the "IPv4 Local Scope" range 
<a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2365.txt">[RFC2365]</a>, that 
is the range 239.255.0.0 to 239.255.255.255 (i.e. 239.255.0.0/16).  
Traffic destined to destinations should be kept within a 'local' area, 
and certainly within a physical site.


<p>Port 9753 is defined in the 
<a href="http://www.iana.org/assignments/port-numbers">Port Numbers</a> 
list also as "rasadv" i.e.</p>

<pre class="CodeExample">...
rasadv		9753/tcp    rasadv
rasadv		9753/udp    rasadv

<p>(Personal information in the trace has been changed i.e. source MAC 
and IP address and hostname).</p>


<!-- ========================================= -->
<h1>When</h1>
<p>Monitoring shows that a packet is send once per hour.</p>


<!-- ========================================= -->
<h1>Why</h1>
<p>It is presumed that the packets are sent to advertise that the 
local machine is running RAS/RRAS (that is "[Routing and] Remote Access Server" 
for any non-Microsoft aware readers).  No documentation of this has 
been found however.</p>
<p>This behaviour is useful in a corporate network where it will 
allow administrators to detect any Windows machines that are 
running RAS. Unauthorised RAS devices create a very dangerous 
security risk, no use in having that super-duper firewall if people can 
dial-in to your network through some unprotected RAS device.</p>

<p>
It appears that the <code>netsh</code> tool within Windows 
can be used to show the advertising RAS servers.  It has a command 
<code>show activeservers</code> within the <code>ras</code> context that
will display any advertisements received.  It listens on the multicast 
address and will thus receive any of these advertisements sent on the 
'Local Scope' network.  For instance:
</p>
<pre class="CodeExample">C:\>netsh
netsh>ras
ras>show activeservers

Timestamp                 Sender
------------------------  ----------------------------------
Tue Dec 10 18:36:49 2002  192.105.90.102 (thepcsdnsname.example.com)
   Hostname=thepcsname
</pre>

<p>There is a tool in the Resource Kit called <code>raslist.exe</code>
that serves a similar purpose.  When run, it produces initially:
</p>
<pre class="CodeExample">C:\>"\Program Files\Resource Pro Kit\raslist.exe"
RASLIST - list of RAS servers on the net
press &lt;ESC&gt; to exit
Initializing...
Ready to receive RAS announces on LANA0
</pre>
<p>
The <code>LANA0</code> identifier suggests to me NetBIOS use, which is 
odd.  Anyway on my machine when I use it I do not see the IGMP Report 
appear on my active LAN card, this is likely due to the machine having 
multiple NIC and dial-up connections defined (if not active).  
It is probably best to use the <code>netsh</code> version.</p>
<p>
Note: As for all Multicast receive usage, if you are running a packet 
sniffer or a personal firewall that logs such outgoing traffic, when you 
run either of the commands you will (should) see an 
IGMP Membership report packet for the group (i.e. 239.255.2.2) being 
sent.   This is the Internet Group Management Protocol being used to 
tell the network that this machines wants to receive traffic on the 
239.255.2.2 multicast group.  If your network is multicast enabled then 
your machine will start to receive the advertisement from the machines 
running RAS on your network.  You also will continue being sent regular 
IGMP Membership Query packets from the elected Multicast router on your 
network, your machine will send the same Report in reply to each.
If your network is not multicast enabled 
then you will only receive advertisement from machines on the same LAN 
segment.
</p>



<!-- ========================================= -->
<h1>How (does it affect me)</h1>
<p>If you are connected directly to the Internet, whether through 
dial-up, CableModem, <i>x</i>DSL, you may be worried that the sending 
of this packet poses some security risk to you.</p>

<p>Firstly I do not hold to the idea that a device is safer if 
arbitrary machines on the Internet cannot detect its presence.  
If an attacker is going to run an attack, he just runs the attack on 
the given service on a large arbitrary set of addresses.  He does 
not bother to attempt to find which machines are active by Pinging etc.  
Nor is it worth trying to find out by secondary means whether a 
particular service is active, just attack the service and see if it 
responds or fails...
</p>

<h2>Scope of delivery</h2>
<p>As this packet is being sent to a group 
address it requires that a Multicast enabled 
network exists to forward it.  A router that does not have special 
multicast configuration applied will not forward such packets.  
I personally know of no ISPs that have multicast enabled their network.  
If any have it is likely that they are set up to deliver multicast to 
the clients but not allow them to send multicasts.  You would have to be 
specifically authorised to send multicast packets through its network.  
Usually the first router (remote access device, CMTS, DSLAM etc) will 
not forward multicasts and will just drop them.  
As noted in the <b><i>What</i></b> section the group address used by 
these packets should restrict the delivery of them to within the local 
site.
The only receiver of these packets could thus be the ISP itself and 
only then if they have carried out special configuration on the first 
hop router.</p>

<h2>Information exposed</h2>
<p>Now lets look at what information the packets might expose.  
There are four pieces of information possibly exposed</p>
<ul>
<li>firstly that a device exists currently with that IP address</li>
<li>secondly that it is running Windows 2000 or similar</li>
<li>thirdly the hostname that the PC is configured with</li>
<li>fourthly that the PC is running RAS</li>
</ul>
<p>The first three pieces of 
information will be provided already to your ISP at connect time; 
for dial-up though PPP negotiation and on Cable Modem etc through 
DHCP.  So it does not provide any new information.</p>

<p>The information that RAS is running is the only piece of 
new information being exposed to your ISP.  The fact that you are running 
RAS is not terribly useful anyway, to try an attack dial-in they will have to 
know the phone number of the attached modem.</p>

<p>I thus feel that the risk created by these packets is  
low to non-existent.</p>

<h2>Later notes</h2>
<p>It has also been pointed out to me that RRAS could be being used to 
accept VPN connections from the Internet.  This creates a different 
risk from when only modems are being used: there is no need to know 
the phone number that the modem is attached to...</p>

<p>For a long while I was not seeing any of these packets from RRAS 
even though RRAS was running.  At the time I had no modem devices 
configured, but was just using the IrNet ("Infrared Port") connection 
type.  So, does 
RRAS only send the rasadv packets when a modem is configured, or was I 
just not seeing them because I wasn't looking hard enough..., or was 
something else at play...?  Anyway they have returned now.</p>

<p>Later.  Of course, after all that waffling about them disappearing 
and reappearing, they have now disappeared again.</p>

<p>This feature also exists in Windows XP, and 
I've had a report that this feature exists in Windows Server 2003 
(thanks).</p>
