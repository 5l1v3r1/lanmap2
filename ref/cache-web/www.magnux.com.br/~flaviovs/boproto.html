<h1>The Back Orifice (BO) Protocol</h1>

<h2>Introductory Notes</h2>

<ul>

<li>This specification was obtained by looking at the sources of the
<a href="http://www.cultdeadcow.com/">BO client for Unix</a> and in
the development stage of <a
href="http://www.magnux.com/nobo/">NOBO</a>. It probably doesn't cover
all aspects of the protocol and may contain incorrect information; such
items are tagged with &quot;(???)&quot;. If you find something missing
or wrong in this document, please, <a
href="mailto:flaviovs@magnux.com">let me know</a>.

<li>All numeric values are represented in decimal notation or, if
prefixed with a &quot;<code>0x</code>&quot;
(e.g. &quot;<code>0x0f</code>&quot;), in hexadecimal, unless noted
otherwise.</li>

</ul>


<h2>The Protocol</h2>

<p>The exchange of data between the BO client and server is done using
encrypted UDP packets. The format of these packer's is simple, as is the
cryptographic scheme used. The server normally binds to UDP port
31337, but it may be configured to use another port. All BO packets --
from the server to the client and vice-versa -- have the same basic
format. Notice that even if no password is set up on the server and
client, BO packets are <b>always</b> encrypted.


<h2>Packet Format</h2>

BO packets are composed of a 17 bytes header which contains the
characteristics of the packet, plus payload data (at least 1 byte). The
packets ends with a one byte CRC (???).

<h4>Header Fields</h4>

<p> MAGIC - An eight byte string which identifies the BO packet. The
sequence of characters is fixed and must be the string
&quot;<code>*!*QWTY?</code>&quot; (star, bang, star, &quot;Q&quot;,
&quot;W&quot;, &quot;T&quot;, &quot;Y&quot;, question).

<p> LEN - A 32 bit integer which contains the length of the
entire packet, including the header. The value of this field cannot be
less than 19 (the header length plus, at least, 1 byte data and 1 byte
CRC).

<p> ID - A 32 bit integer which contains the identification of the UDP
packet. This field is used to keep track of the
fragment sequence number of fragmented packets (???). It's also used by the BO client to
match a received packet with previously packets sent.

<blockquote><i> 
The &quot;32 bit integers&quot; used in the header of
  BO packets aren't transmitted in network order, but with its least
  significant byte sent first. For example, the &quot;integer&quot;
  </i><code>0x11bb55ee</code><i> is transmitted is this order:
  </i><code>0xee</code><i>, </i><code>0x55</code><i>,
  </i><code>0xbb</code><i> and </i><code>0x11</code><i>.
  </i></blockquote>

<p>T - This field contains the operation type that the packet
carries. In this field, the 2 most significant bits are used to flag
some conditions about the packet, such as the fragmentation of a large
packet. The remaining 6 bits are used to specify the actual BO
operation.

<h2>Data</h2>

The data field of a BO packet comes right after the header. It's
composed of a simple sequence of characters, ended by a character with
ASCII code 0 (zero) -- NUL. This terminator character is mandatory --
this mean that the data field must be at least 1 byte long (???).

<p>The contents of the data field should be interpreted differently if
the packet goes from the server to the client, or if it goes in the
opposite way (???). In packets going from the client to the server, up
to two string sequences can be sent in the data field, as they're
separated by a NUL character. In packets going from the server to the
client, there is only one string (???) with the command response.

</blockquote>

<h2>CRC</h2>

After the data field, there is a 1-byte field containing the CRC of the
packet (???). The BO server seems to silently ignore the value of this
byte.

<h2>Cryptography</h2>

All BO packets are encrypted. The entire BO packet (including the
header) is encrypted. The cryptographic scheme used is simple, and
depends on a secret key (the password) which must be known by the two
parties. The password is used only to encrypt packets; the password
never travels over the network.

<p>The encryption is done applying a XOR (exclusive or) operation
between each byte of the packet and the sequential value returned by a
random number generator. This generator is initialized with a value
which depends on the secret password being used in the
communication. This way, having the same password, both random number
generator (the server's and the client's one) will be initialized with
the same seed, and they will return the same sequence of
&quot;random&quot; numbers which will be used to encrypt/decrypt the
packet.

<p> This cryptographic scheme isn't strong. As all of the packet
contents is encrypted, and they always contain a fixed sequence of
characters (MAGIC) in the header, from inspection of a single encrypted
packet it may be possible to obtain the initial sequence of random
numbers generated and use
a brute force attack to discover the random number
generator seed. This is very feasible because the range of possible values is somewhat small. The
methods used to decrypt and encrypt a BO packet without knowing the
password being used are out of the scope of this document, and are
left as an exercise to the reader.

<h3>The Random Number Generator</h3>

The BO protocol uses the following random number generator function:

<blockquote>
<code>BORAND(x) = (x * 214013) + 2531011</code>
</blockquote>

<p>Where &quot;<code>A * B</code>&quot; denotes the multiplication of
A by B, and &quot;<code>+</code>&quot; the usual sum operation.

<p>The value of the initial parameter (the seed) is derived from
the communication password (see below). The next value is always the
result of the value returned by the last run. For example, a sequence
of &quot;random&quot; numbers <code>X<sub>1</sub>, X<sub>2</sub>, ...,
X<sub>n</sub></code> can be obtained in the following way:

<blockquote>
<pre>
X<sub>1</sub> = BORAND(IV)
X<sub>2</sub> = BORAND(X<sub>1</sub>)
X<sub>3</sub> = BORAND(X<sub>2</sub>)
    ...
X<sub>n</sub> = BORAND(X<sub>n - 1</sub>)
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
Where <code>IV</code> is the seed and <code>X<sub>n</sub></code> is
the <i>n<sup>th</sup></i> random number.

<h3>The Seed</h3>

The seed to be used on the BO random number generator is generated
using the communication password. If no password is being used, the
special value of 31337 is used as the seed. Otherwise, the following
algorithm gives the seed from a password <code>S</code>:

<blockquote>
<pre>
X = 0
Y = length (number of characters) of S
Z = 0
WHILE X &lt; Y
	Z = Z + S[X]
	X = X + 1
END

X = 0
WHILE X &lt; Y
	IF X is odd
		Z = Z - (S[X] * (Y - X + 1))
	ELSE
		Z = Z + (S[X] * (Y - X + 1))
	END
	Z = Z % 0x7fffffff
	X = X + 1
END
Z = (Z * Y) % 0x7fffffff
IV = Z
</pre>
</blockquote>
   
Where &quot;<code>S[n]</code>&quot; is the <i>n<sup>th</sup></i>
character of the password, &quot;<code>A % B</code>&quot; the
remainder of the division of A by B, and &quot;<code>IV</code>&quot;
the seed we're looking for.

<p>Note: the random number generator is reinitialized with the a new
seed every time a packet is sent.

<p>Note: the variables <code>X</code>, <code>Y</code> and
<code>Z</code> are all 32 bit integer. This mean that the most
significant bits above the 32<sup>nd</sup> one should be ignored when
an overflow occurs.

<h2>Encrypting/decrypting</h2>

The following algorithm is a demonstration of how a BO packet can be
encrypted or decrypted:

<blockquote>
<pre>
L = length of the BO packet
X = 0
Z = IV
WHILE X &lt; L
	Z = BORAND(Z)
 	P[X] = P[X] ^ ((Z &gt;&gt; 16) &amp; 0xff)
	X = X + 1
END
</pre>
</blockquote>

Where &quot;<code>P[n]</code>&quot; denotes the <i>n<sup>th</sup></i>
byte of the packet, &quot;<code>A ^ B</code>&quot; the bitwise
<em>XOR</em> operation between A and B, &quot;<code>A &gt;&gt;
B</code>&quot; the 32 bit shift of A by B bits to the right, and
&quot;<code>A &amp; B</code>&quot; the bitwise AND operation between A
and B.


<h2>TCP file transfer</h2>

The transfer of files using TCP (operations TYPE_TCPFILESEND and
TYPE_TCPFILERECIVED) is done with the server opening the port specified
in the parameter of the command.

<p>When the client sends a TYPE_TCPFILESEND packet, the server opens
the file specified and start listening for a TCP connection on the
specified TCP port. Then the client connects to that port and start
sending the file.

<p>When the client wishes to receive a file, it sends a
TYPE_TCPFILERECEIVE packet specifying the desired file name and
the TCP port. The server will then open the specified port and start
transferring the file as soon as someone (probably the client)
connects to it.

<p>The TCP stream is not encrypted.

<i>All this TCP file send/receive stuff is &quot;(???)&quot;.</i>
