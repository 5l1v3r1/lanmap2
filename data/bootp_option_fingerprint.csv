# BOOTP/DHCP signature -> OS mapping
#
# DHCP is everywhere these days (and it is broadcast so it is easily visible).
# Operating systems can be identified by the pattern of BOOTP options contained within.
#
# How to add signatures:
#   Get a packet inspecting program such as tcpdump, wireshark, etc.
#   If you have access to a machine
#     restart the DHCP client
#   otherwise
#     just sit and wait
#   When you see a packet, check it out and record it.
#   If the packet already exists, add the machine type to it.
#   If not, enter the data and classify it.
#   The important thing is to classify things as *specifically* as possible at first,
#     so if the packet was from Windows XP SP2, then just label it as that. It's very
#     possible that SP1 has the same behavior, maybe NT4 does too. But until that is
#     tested it's important to keep things as closely targetted as possible.
