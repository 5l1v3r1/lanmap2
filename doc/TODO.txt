* devise a simple yet powerful design so that that mappings can be
  nested arbitrarily in a tree, for example:

	if we know that address A is a Linksys WRT54G device, we
	should be able to determine, from this specific hint, that
	it's also a router, a wifi router, has 4 wired ports, runs MIPS
	and has an image at img/hardware/WRT54G.png, all from that one
	specific hint.

	we should be able to extrapolate simpler information from a
	complex hint.

* add support for multiple web-based clients modifying

* add support for populating the 'host' and 'host_addr' tables from
  our "aggregate" php script; we'll split the process of defining
  hosts and of creating the actual map into at least 2 separate steps.

* once that's done we can have proper support for the concept of
  multi-faceted "Devices".

* import list of Cisco devices.
