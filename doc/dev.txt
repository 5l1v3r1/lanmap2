How To Structure the Database to Allow Hinting At Individual Properties
But Also Complex "Device" Types?

Id		Parent	Type	Contents
N			NULL		Role	Router
N+1		NULL		Dev		WRT54G
N+2		Manuf	

Aha, I think I've figured it out.

Being able to identify a full device is the ultimate goal!

Everything else should be subordinate.

Everything else we can hint at is ultimately a device field:

Manufacturer
Role(s)
Model#
Device-specific info
	(i.e. how many ports on the bridge)
Image/icon
