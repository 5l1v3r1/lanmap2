About
-----

lanmap2 is a successor to my original lanmap software; it passively listens
to LAN traffic and can construct an interactive visualization of the machines,
operating systems and applications present on the LAN from the "hints" it
extracts.

lanmap2 is a bottom-up rewrite of lanmap; it fixes a lot of protocol parsing
and abstracts much of the internal application behind well-defined interfaces;
something lanmap did not do.

That being said, it doesn't currently work quite as lanmap does, so buyer
beware; however, lanmap2 contains the structure that will allow it to surpass
lanmap once it is mature.

Installation
------------

Everything is pretty much manual at this point, oh well.

Dependencies:
	sqlite3 and libsqlite3 (sqlite2 not acceptable!)
	libpcap
	gcc
	php (to interface with db and generate graphviz input; plan on replacing with lua)
	graphviz (for graph generating)

  debian based (including ubuntu):
    sudo apt-get install libpcap-dev libsqlite3-dev gcc graphviz php5-cli php5-sqlite sqlite3

1. Build the database

	db/build-db.sh

2. Build the capture

	cd src &&  make 2>&1 | grep -v bit-field


Use
---

1. Start capturing

  cd db && sudo ../src/cap && cd -

  The application has to run as root, which is a potential security hazard.

	This currently produces prodigious amounts of output; sue me.

2. Generate a graph after letting the capture run for a while.

	cd graph && ./graph.sh && cd -

	This will generate a graph at graph/net.png

  This runs a bunch of php scripts.

3. View the graph via the web/ crap

  I suggest you map/symlink apache to the web/ directory if you are capable


TODO
----

* Replace php-based "graph"ing scripts with lua-based ones, and include lua
  runtime and libraries within the lanmap2 package; this will simplify the
  dependencies and allow more people to run it.
